# Unity-Ocean-With-Job-System
Pretty simple example about Job System.

##Usage
-Create an empty GameObject
-Add "WavesJobber.cs" script to GameObject
-Add MeshRenderer Component to GameObject
That's all.

Now you can edit **ocean dimension** and add new **noise layer**

###Note: Make sure to enable **Use Job System** boolean for optimizing.
