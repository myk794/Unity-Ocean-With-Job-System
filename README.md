# Unity-Ocean-With-Job-System
Pretty simple example about Job System.

## Usage
- Create an empty GameObject.
- Add "WavesJobber.cs" script to GameObject.
- Add MeshRenderer Component to GameObject.
- Edit **ocean dimension** and add new **noise layer** from Inspector.
That's all.
Now just click to play button and see the results. You can try to disable UseJobSystem to see Job System & Burst Compiler difference.




### Note: Make sure to enable **Use Job System** boolean for optimizing.
